        <p>The Briard originated in the Brie region of north-central France, where it was traditionally used for both herding sheep and defending them. The first known written mention of the shepherd dogs of Brie is found in the Cours complet d'agriculture by Jean-Baptiste François Rozier in 1783, where he described the "chien de Brie" as a long-haired, usually black dog. Rozier noted that in the open plains, there was little danger from wolves, so the dogs were used primarily for herding rather than defense. Their main task was to prevent the sheep from wandering into crops or vineyards where they could cause damage. In 1895, Pierre Mégnin clearly distinguished the short-haired Chien de Beauce, or modern Beauceron, from the long-haired Chien de Brie, or Briard. In 1896, Mégnin helped found the Club des chiens de berger français.</p>
